# Introduction

This header-only module provides C++ classes and several accompanying methods to work with n-d matrices and/or tensors. It's usage, programmatically and from a compilation perspective, is really simple. One just has to include the relevant header file and tell your compiler where it is located (and to the C++11 or younger standard). Really, that's it!
