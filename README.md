[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cppmat/badge/?version=latest)](http://cppmat.geus.me/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This header-only module provides C++ classes and several accompanying methods to work with n-d matrices and/or tensors. It's usage, programmatically and from a compilation perspective, is really simple. One just has to include the relevant header file and tell your compiler where it is located (and to the C++11 or younger standard). Really, that's it!
